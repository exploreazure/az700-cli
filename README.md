# AZ-700 Lab Environment

This readme contains the Azure CLI commands I used to create each lab environment. Many tutorials deploy resources the portal, which is a good way to learn about the options available during deployment.

I wanted to use the Azure CLI, so I can deploy and destroy resources quickly within my subscription. 

## Lab Environment via the portal
This video by Susanth Sutheesh describes how resources are deployed via the portal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFdOi0QVso4  - I would recommend viewing this video, as part of your preparation for AZ-700. As a DevOps engineer, I have followed the excellent instructions in the YouTube video and produced Azure CLI commands for each lab exercise.

I would suggest looking at the all the available parameters available using the Microsoft Azure CLI documentation, as you run each Azure CLI command.
